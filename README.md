# Professional README Generator

![badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue?style=plastic)

## Description

When creating an open source project on GitHub, it’s important to have a high-quality README file. You can quickly and easily create a README file by using a command-line application to generate one. This allows the project creator to devote more time to working on the project. I’ve created a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README file from a user's input using the Inquirer package.
